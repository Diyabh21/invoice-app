## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- An [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/)

### 1. Clone & install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/invoicer.git
cd invoicer
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Frontend — Vite picks this up automatically
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

Create a `.env` file in the `server/` directory:

```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
PORT=3001
```

### 3. Run the dev servers

In one terminal, start the API proxy:

```bash
node server/index.js
```

In another terminal, start the Vite dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

---

## Demo Account

The app ships with a pre-seeded in-memory user:

| Field    | Value               |
|----------|---------------------|
| Email    | demo@example.com    |
| Password | demo1234            |

You can also register a new account — it lives in memory for the session.

> **Note:** All data is in-memory only. Refreshing the page resets invoices and users (except the demo account).

---

## Backend — API Proxy

The Express server in `server/index.js` proxies requests to Anthropic so your API key is never exposed to the browser.

```
POST /api/generate
```

Accepts the same body as the [Anthropic Messages API](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages) and forwards it with your server-side `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

---

## Deployment

### Frontend — Netlify / Vercel

```bash
npm run build
# deploy the dist/ folder
```

Set the environment variable in your hosting dashboard:

```
VITE_API_URL=https://your-api-server.onrender.com
```

### Backend — Render / Railway

Point your host to `server/index.js` as the start command:

```bash
node server/index.js
```

Set the environment variable:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

Update the CORS origin in `server/index.js` from `"*"` to your deployed frontend URL for production.
